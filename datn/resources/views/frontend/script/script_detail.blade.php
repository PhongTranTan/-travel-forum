                    I love the noodles here but it is so rare that I get to come here. Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles is the best type of whole in the wall restaurant. The staff are really nice, and you should be seated quickly. I usually get thehand pulled noodles in a soup. House Special #1 is amazing and the lamb noodles are also great. If you want your noodles a little chewier, get the knife cut noodles, which are also amazing. Their dumplings are great
                    dipped in their chili sauce.
